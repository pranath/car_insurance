# Car insurance data analysis & modelling

In this project I will look at data that relates to behavioural characteristics of customers who have taken out car insurance. The data has been obfuscated with the exception of the field called 'target', which is an indicator to show which customers have claimed. The data stems from two separate systems, hence the need for two csv files. Please note that each row in ‘data1.csv’ corresponds to the same row number in the data2.csv file.

My task is to model the data with respect to the 'target' field and provide any other insights you may find within the data.
